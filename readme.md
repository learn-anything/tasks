# Tasks

> Tasks done exposed as library functions or HTTP endpoints

Goal of the repo is to serve as a place to build out tasks that are in use by [Learn Anything](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything.xyz) and generalise it to be used by community at large.

Full list of tasks is here:

- [Chat with markdown](chat-with-markdown) - Ingest a folder of `.md` files and create RAG system
- [Questions and answers](questions-and-answers) - Ask a question, get similar questions asked
- [Solana Escrow](solana-escrow) - Multi sig wallet setup to do escrow for idea investments and bounties
- [Suggest subtasks](suggest-subtasks) - Given a task, get subtasks to finish the task
- [Web crawler](web-crawler) - Scraping of websites like HN/Reddit/Lobsters/..
- [Topic suggestions](topic-suggestions) - Given a topic, show similar topics
- [LLM](llm) - Open Large Language Model infused with LA data

Some are incomplete, some are already used in production in LA.
